It's made up of dead and decaying plants and animals, fecal matter, and even dust particles. This \"snow\" drifts down for days, weeks, or even months, providing crucial sustenance to organisms in the perpetually dark and nutrient-poor deep sea. Without marine snow, the deep ocean ecosystem wouldn't be able to survive!\n"
